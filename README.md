# 🚚 Reverse Logistics Optimization

**Duration:** Jan 2025 – Mar 2025  
**Type:** Self Project — Business / Operations Focus

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce return operations and proposes practical strategies to reduce costs and improve turnaround times. By combining data-driven analysis with an optimization framework and clear dashboards, the study produces actionable insights for operations teams and supply-chain managers.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify patterns and inefficiencies in returns (costs, distances, processing times).  
- Propose an optimization approach to minimize reverse logistics costs and improve service levels.  
- Provide management-friendly dashboards and KPIs for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data analysis** — Synthesized and analyzed return records to find cost drivers and bottlenecks.  
2. **Optimization** — Built a linear programming model to optimize return routing and center allocation under capacity and SLA constraints.  
3. **Visualization** — Created dashboards to track KPIs and compare baseline vs optimized scenarios, enabling quick business decisions.

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Pinpointed high-cost, long-distance return flows and processing bottlenecks.  
- Demonstrated **~12–15% potential cost savings** in simulation through optimized routing and allocation.  
- Reduced average turnaround time by streamlining returns assignment and processing.  
- Delivered a replicable, scalable framework that operations teams can adapt to live data.

## 🛠 For Recruiters & Non-Technical Readers
- This is an **operations-focused** project: emphasis is on measurable business impact (cost reduction, faster returns), not on complex code.  
- Dashboards and the report translate technical results into KPIs and recommended operational changes.  
- If you’d like a short walkthrough or a demo screenshot to include in a portfolio or CV, check the `dashboards/` folder or the public Notion page linked below.
